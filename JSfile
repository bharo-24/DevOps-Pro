// Javascript program to swap two
// numbers without using temporary
// variable
 
let x = 10, y = 5;
console.log("Before Swapping: x = " + 
    x + ", y = " + y);
 
// Code to swap 'x' and 'y'
 
// x now becomes 15
x = x + y;
 
// y becomes 10
y = x - y;
 
// x becomes 5
x = x - y;
 
console.log("After Swapping: x = " +

output:-

Before Swapping: x = 10, y = 5
After Swapping: x = 5, y = 10
